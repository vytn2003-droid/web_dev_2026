        <h2>Why I Enjoy Cooking</h2>
        <p>
          Cooking is something I enjoy because it allows me to slow down and be creative while still being productive.
          It’s a hands-on activity where small decisions can completely change the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like experimenting with flavors, learning new techniques, and improving through practice, which is similar
          to how I approach learning technology.

        <h2>Connection to My Career Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Cooking has taught me patience, organization, and problem-solving. If something goes wrong, you troubleshoot,
          adjust, and try again. Those same skills apply to cybersecurity and technical work.

      <h2>Favorite Part</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite part of cooking is sharing food with others. It’s rewarding to see people enjoy something you made
        from scratch.
