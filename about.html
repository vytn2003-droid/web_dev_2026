        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior studying Information Communication Technology. I’m especially interested in cybersecurity,
          and I want to keep improving both my technical skills and my ability to explain technical topics clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m working toward a career in Cybersecurity Sales Engineering because it combines technology, communication,
          and real-world problem solving.

          In my coursework, I’m learning how organization, usability, and accessibility affect whether a website is
          actually usable for different people.
